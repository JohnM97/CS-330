Reflection on 3D Scene Project
Design Approach
For this project, I focused on creating a realistic 3D scene with a single 8-sided die. My approach was to break down each task—modeling, lighting, and textures—into manageable steps, testing each as I went to ensure a polished final product. This modular design process taught me to stay organized and improve elements individually.

Development Strategies
To keep the code manageable, I used custom functions for tasks like rendering the die, setting up lighting, and camera controls. This modular strategy allowed me to easily refine parts without affecting the whole. Frequent testing helped me catch issues early and make each iteration smoother.

Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened my skills in 3D modeling, textures, and lighting in OpenGL, giving me practical experience in computational graphics. These skills are directly applicable to my future goals, especially in areas like game development and interactive visualizations, where clear, engaging user experiences are essential.
